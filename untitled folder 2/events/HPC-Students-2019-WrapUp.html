<p>The HPC Students Program focuses on educating and training the next generation of High-Performance Computing professionals and researchers. It is designed to educate students from high school to grad school about HPC, to motivate them to pursue HPC careers, and to serve as a bridge between students and HPC-related research and researchers. This spring, several efforts were launched, including:
<ul>
<li> Sponsoring the formation of the <a href="http://supercomputingclub.ucsd.edu/">UCSD Supercomputing Club</a>: including providing meeting room space and supercomputer accounts, and hosting a lab space for the club</li>
<li>HPC Training Sessions</a>: a 10 week training session in HPC, resulting in Co-Curricular Record Credit</li>
<li>Formation of a Summer cluster buildout team: in progress</li>
<li>Connecting students to help update a Raspberry PI cluster</li>
<li>Preparation for student cluster competition teams (next one due in November for the International Supercomputing Conference, Frankfurt, Germany)
</ul>

<b>Supercomputing Club Studython<br>
Session #1: 10:00 am - 3:00 pm<br>
Session #2:  5:00 pm - 8:00 pm<br></b>
