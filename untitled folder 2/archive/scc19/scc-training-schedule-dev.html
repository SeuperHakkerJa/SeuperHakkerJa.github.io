To help prepare our team for the competition, we have planned a series of training sessions, to be held on Fridays from 1:00pm to 3:00pm in the SDSC SynCenter (or the Auditorium, if needed). Note: this schedule is still in flux as we await input from the official <a href="http://www.studentclustercompetition.us/2019/overview.html"> SCC program</a>. The scope of the training effort includes several skill development activities, including:
<ul>
   <li> Study HPC architectures, software, and admin skills.  </li>
   <li> Learn the basics of parallel programming, including MPI using C, Fortran, and possibly other languages.  </li>
   <li> Running HPC applications in the areas of performance characterization of the cluster, bioinformatics, numerical methods, password security, and other applications.  </li>
   <li> Visualization and analysis of big data sets.  </li>
   <li> Work as a team to develop and work on the items above.  </li>
</ul>
Students will give accounts on <a http="https://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/comet.html">Comet</a>, the SDSC Supercomputer, and be given the opportunity to complete several basic assignments. Students who successfully complete the HPC Training program will receive an <em>SDSC Certificate of Completion in HPC Training</em>, and will become eligible to apply to be on the SCC Core team. Note: the final SCC team who will travel to the competition will be chosen from this group.
