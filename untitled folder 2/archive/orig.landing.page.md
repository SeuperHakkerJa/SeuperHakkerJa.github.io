### Who are we?

The High Performance Computing Students (HPC-Students) Group is a collaboration between San Diego Supercomputer Center
and University of California, San Diego Supercomputing Club.

To learn more about HPC Students, please see: [HPC Students Program](https://www.sdsc.edu/education_and_training/hpc_students.html).


### Join the Supercomputing Club on Slack!

If you have a ucsd.edu email address, you can join us on our Slack Workspace to get the most up to date information on the club.

### What is the Supercomputing Clubs' goal?


This club exists to provide exposure to Supercomputers and High Performance Computing to interested students.
The field of High Performance Computing (HPC) spans many domains outside in Scientific Computing including Applied Math,
Physics, Biology, and Data and Environmental Sciences.
Along the way, the group will learn concepts common in HPC including optimization, distributed computing, cloud computing, containers, GPU acceleration, and parallel code at scale.

Secondarily, we aim to build a team of students to compete in Student Cluster Competitions around the world.
Last year's US competition, held at the annual supercomputing [SC'18](https://sc18.supercomputing.org) meeting in Dallas, challenged students to build, run, and optimize applications that included Deep Learning,
Monte Carlo approximations, weather forecasting, and earthquake simulation.


### Who do we seek?


It is our firm belief that the most important quality of prospective members is motivation;
most of the necessary skills can be taught with a relatively gentle learning curve.

You are especially encouraged to apply if any of these are true of you:
- You want to participate in building and optimizing a supercomputer
- You'd like to execute code on the fastest computers in the world
- You enjoy working with the Linux Command Line
- Belonging to an inclusive technology focused community on campus appeals to you.

We'd love your help getting this club off the ground.
It won't be the same without you.

### How do I get involved?

We're having an info session at San Diego Supercomputer Center on January 18th
You're invited to come see the supercomputers, learn more about the club we're starting, and get some free food.

Please fill out the form in the link to RSVP and tell us a bit about yourself.

### More on the Student Cluster Competition

From [sc19.org](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/program/studentssc/student-cluster-competition/):
> "The Student Cluster Competition (SCC) was developed in 2007 to provide an immersive high performance computing experience to undergraduate and high school students.
> With sponsorship from hardware and software vendor partners, student teams design and build small clusters,
> learn scientific applications, apply optimization techniques for their chosen architectures, and compete in a non-stop,
> 48-hour challenge at the SC conference to complete a real-world scientific workload,
> showing off their HPC knowledge for conference attendees and judges."

SDSC is excited to announce that HPC Students will begin training UCSD students to participate in its Student Cluster Competition Program startingi with an informational session on Friday, April 5th.
We have planned a series of 9-10 training sessions, to be held on Fridays from 1:00pm to 3:00pm in the SDSC SynCenter, or the Auditorium.  The scope of the training effort includes several skill development activities. 

To learn about the SCC program and to register to participate, please see:<b> [SDSC Student Cluster Competition Info](https://training.sdsc.edu/scc.html).</b>

One of the students starting the Supercomputing Club participated in the sc18 Student Cluster Competition with their community college.
Additionally, a staff member at San Diego Supercomputer Center participated twice previously with a team from San Diego State University.
They are both eager to help another team do the same this Fall at [SC'19](https://sc19.supercomputing.org) in Denver, Colorado.

While any students are eligible to join the Student HPC group, participants in the competition are restricted to students enrolled at an educational institution that have NOT been granted an undergraduate degree when the event starts.
