SDSC supports training of its user community, including students, in all aspects of High-performance computing (HPC). We have planned a series of training sessions, to be held on Fridays from 1:00pm to 3:00pm in the SDSC SynCenter (or the Auditorium, if needed).  The scope of the training effort includes several skill development activities, including:
<ul>
   <li> Study HPC architectures, software, and admin skills.  </li>
   <li> Learn the basics of parallel programming, including MPI using C, Fortran, and possibly other languages.  </li>
   <li> Running HPC applications in the areas of performance characterization of the cluster, bioinformatics, numerical methods, password security, and other applications.  </li>
   <li> Visualization and analysis of big data sets.  </li>
   <li> Working as a team to develop and work on the items above.  </li>
</ul>
Students will be given accounts on <a http="https://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/comet.html">Comet</a>, the SDSC Supercomputer, and be given the opportunity to complete several basic assignments. Students who successfully complete the HPC Training program will receive an <em>SDSC Certificate of Completion in HPC Training</em>, and will become eligible to apply for <a href="https://hpc-students.sdsc.edu/sdsc-ccr-program.html">UCSD Co-Curricular Credit</a>
