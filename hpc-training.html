<h3>Description of the Program</h3> 
SDSC supports the training of its user community, including students, 
in all aspects of High-performance computing (HPC). The goal of the
training is to prepare new HPC users to run jobs on HPC systems. For 
more advanced training, please see our <a 
href="https://www.sdsc.edu/education_and_training/training.html">webinars 
  and workshops</a> which are targeted to more experienced users.

SDSC supports training of its user community, including students, collaborators, staff, in all aspects of High-performance computing (HPC). We have planned a series of training sessions, to be held on Fridays from 1:00pm to 3:00pm in the SDSC SynCenter (or the Auditorium, if needed) that will introduce participants to a variety of HPC topics and skill development activities, including:
<ul>
<li>Basic Linux and using Jupyter Notebooks.</li>
<li>HPC architectures, software, and admin skills.</li>
<li>Parallel programming basics, including GPU/CUDA, OpenMP and MPI using Python, C, Fortran, and possibly other languages.</li>
<li>Performance characterization of the cluster, numerical methods, and other applications.</li>
<li>Visualization and analysis of big data sets.</li>
<li>Machine learning fundamentals.</li>
<li>Work as a team to develop and work on the items above.</li>
</ul>

<h3> How the Training Sessions Work</h3>
Participants will be given accounts on <a href="https://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/comet.html">Comet</a>, the SDSC Supercomputer, and be given the opportunity to complete several basic assignments. Participants who successfully complete the HPC Training program will receive an <em>SDSC Certificate of Completion in HPC Training</em>. Students who complete the course will also be eligible to receive [UCSD Co-Curricular Credit]() for their efforts. There is no grade in the course. To sucessfully complete the course, participants must attendi most of the sessions and complete approximately 80% of the work. Participants are encouraged to work as teams, and can work on the assignments past the last date of training sessions with the approval of the instructor.
