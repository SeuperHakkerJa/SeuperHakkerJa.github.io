The <a href="https://www.sdsc.edu">San Diego Supercomputer Center</a> and HPC Students are pleased to announce the SDSC Co-Curricular Record (SDSC-CCR) Program. The program will facilitate awarding CCR credits to SDSC students and interns for activities that they are working on with SDSC and its collaborators.
<p>
The UCSD Co-Curricular Record (CCR) 
(<a href="https://elt.ucsd.edu/ccr">https://elt.ucsd.edu/ccr</a>)
 highlights student achievements in opportunities beyond the classroom including a brief description and the skills developed on an official record. The purpose of the CCR is to demonstrate the value of engaging in opportunities beyond the classroom, and to help students reflect on and articulate the competencies and skills they developed. 
For a list of currently approved UCSD CCR activities, see <a href="https://elt.ucsd.edu/ccr/ccrapprovedopportunities.html">https://elt.ucsd.edu/ccr/index.html</a>.
<p>
The HPC Students Program has been working with the UCSD Co-Curricular Record team to create a system where SDSC staff and researchers can grant Co-Curricular Record credit to thier students. You can find the list of SDSC 
approved CCR positions on the <a href="https://elt.ucsd.edu/ccr/ccrapprovedopportunities.html#San-Diego-Supercomputer-Center-">CCR Approved Opportunities</a> page:

and others pending (related to HPC Training activities).  We have plans to work with SDSC staff and collaborators to create more CCRs that are customized to the student activities. 
<p>
If you are a student, contact your SDSC mentor or supervisor and verify that you are eligible for one of the SDSC CCRs listed above. Then go to the 
<a href="https://elt.ucsd.edu/ccr/get-recognized.html#My-opportunity-is-CCR-Approved">How Do I Get Recognized on the CCR page"</a> and follow the instructions.
<p>
If you are a mentor, contact Mary Thomas (mthomas @ sdsc.edu) for details on how to arrange a CCR for your student. 
<p>
Note: this program is a new program and we ask that you be patient as we work out the details. SDSC is excited to be able to reward our students with the credit and recognition that they have earned. If you have any questions or comments, contact Mary Thomas  (mthomas at sdsc.edu) or Fritz Leader (fritz at ucsd.edu).
